# TimesheetEntryB

A basic MS Forms-based timesheet entry app from 2019 that we are still using, relying on the AutoComplete feature of MS Forms.

This is using a preconfigured Sharepoint site list as the source for matters, reviewers and timekeepers, and also as target for new time entries.

This repository is for archival purposes only.
